# A-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Aircraft-Detection-in-Optical-Remote-Sensing-Imagery
A dataset named Aircraft Detection in Complex Optical Scene (ADCOS), which is obtained from multiple platform sources including Google Earth, Microsoft map, Worldview-3, Pleiades, Orbview-3, Jilin-1 and Ikonos satellites. 

## Dataset Description
Substantial efforts have focused on proposing diverse data-driven methods for aircraft detection in optical remote sensing images. Although researchers have introduced several datasets for aircraft detection, most fail to full address the diversity of target characteristics and the complexity of environmental factors, hindering the effectiveness and reliability of the trained algorithms. To further aircraft detection research, we have established a new dataset, Aircraft Detection in Complex Optical Scene (ADCOS), sourced from various platforms including Google Earth, Microsoft map, Worldview-3, Pleiades, Ikonos, Orbview-3 and Jilin-1 satellites. It integrates 3903 meticulously chosen images of over 400 famous airports worldwide, containing 33831 annotated instances employing the oriented bounding box (OBB) format. Notably, this dataset encompasses a wide range of various targets characteristics including multi-scale, multi-direction, multi-type, multi-state, and dense arrangement, along with complex relationships between targets and backgrounds like cluttered backgrounds, low contrast, shadows, occlusion interference conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate eleven representative detection algorithms on the ADCOS dataset, establishing a performance benchmark for the subsequent algorithm optimization. The latest dataset will soon be available on the github website.
